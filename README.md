AI auto-seeking customer product

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Instead of asking those sales go out and seek for stranger customers, the company can reply on big data and AI to auto-locate the targeting customer, and let the AI process to contact customer first, which would filter the customer base and select those valuable customers to develop their market. KPMG more targeting wealth customer compared to other big fours, which turned out the revenue earned would be much less than others. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

AI, bigdata and blockchain would be the most critical technology need to be used on this service. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

AI would help to auto-seeking customer and auto-reply to customer’s enquiry with the first connection. It would be similar as chatbot but in development which would be more humanity than chatbot. This product would make customer thinking he is talking to a real person instead of robot, which would improve customer experience. Big data is important to help determine the targeting customer and allocate them. Other than that, blockchain service can be used to track each payment to prevent fraudulent.
